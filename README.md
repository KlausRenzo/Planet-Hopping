# Planet Hopping

## The game
Planet Hopping is a 2d cartoon-ish procedural planet-exploration game. It was developed in Pisa (Italy) as a 2019 Global Game Jam entry.  

You exploited your planet, and now you have to flee away, looking for a new home.  
The theme was "What home means to you" and we decided to create a game where the player loses his/her planet and must collect every pieces of it exploring the entire universe. Each new world the player visits is procedurally generated.
